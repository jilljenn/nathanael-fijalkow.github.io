                                        <i>The Orbit Problem consists of determining, given a linear transformation A on Q^d, together with vectors x and y, whether the orbit of x under repeated applications of A can ever reach y. This problem was famously shown to be decidable by Kannan and Lipton in the 1980s.
<br/>
In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of synthesising suitable invariants P included in R^d, i.e., sets that are stable under A and contain x and not y, thereby providing compact and versatile certificates of non-reachability. 
We show that whether a given instance of the Orbit Problem admits a semialgebraic invariant is decidable, and moreover in positive instances we provide an algorithm to synthesise suitable invariants of polynomial size.
<br/>
Our results imply that the class of closed semialgebraic invariants is closure-complete: there exists a closed semialgebraic invariant if and only if y is not in the topological closure of the orbit of x under A.
