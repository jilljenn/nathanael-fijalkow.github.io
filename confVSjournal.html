<h3>Why do I no longer submit to conferences?</h3>

<br/><br/>
Counter-arguments to the usual reasons for submitting to (prestigious) conferences
<ul>
	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#visibility">I want my results to be visible and quickly accessible</a>
	<div id="visibility" class="collapse">
	My answer is one sentence: Put your new results on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>. 
	This is will give your results a very very wide and immediate visibility. 
	Everyone knows and uses arxiv, it is very well referenced by scholar websites.
	Visibility also means recognition, see the next item.
	</div>

	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stamp">I need the stamp of approval from prestigious conferences for my CV and being a member of my research community</a>
	<div id="stamp" class="collapse">
	No you do not. 

	In all the research communities I know, reputation is important and it is not built upon your publications list (conferences or journals).
	Indeed, it gives a first impression, but it is very quickly replaced by your research interactions, ability to present your results, discuss them, relate them to others,
	and engage in developping new ideas.
 
	Every researcher I know will have enough judgment to make his own mind about your results, whether it is published in a top conference or not.
	
	There are many many examples of papers in top conferences that no one ever read, and the other way around papers in less prestigious venues which have attracted a lot of attention.

	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#informed">I want to be informed about the latest important results</a>
	<div id="informed" class="collapse">
	Sign up for the daily or weekly <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">arxiv alerting service</a> on your research interests.
	This will be far more efficient than attending a conference for a broad coverage of the latest results.
	For more specific results you want to talk directly to the relevant researchers, and this is will much more fruitful in a specialised event than in a general conference.

Arguments in favour of submitting to journals
<ul>
	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#time">Avoids the huge waste of time of submitting and resubmitting to conferences</a>

	</div>

	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#reviews">Escapes the unfair system of conference reviews</a>
	<div id="reviews" class="collapse">
	Useless rebuttal, easy rejection arguments, general-oriented conferences are not topic oriented...
	Also a huge waste of time
	</div>

	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stress">Mitigates the stress of rejection</a>
	<div id="stress" class="collapse">

	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#deadlines">Breaks the uncredible pace of conference deadlines</a>

	</div>

	<li><a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#attending">Attending prestigious general conferences is not that productive and sometimes boring</a>
