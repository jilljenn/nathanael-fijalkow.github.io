<h3>Why do I no longer submit to conferences?</h3>

Opinion in progress. I think it is time we break with this toxic system.

Don't get me wrong: this is not a strict rule, but rather a guideline. 
I will submit to conferences in some cases (for instance, in a collaboration with other researchers who would like to publish in conferences).

Also, I do attend (and organise) many scientific events.
I strongly believe that seminar talks, one or two days specialised workshops, week-long group meetings (such as Dagstuhl or CIRM), weeks-long research visits, internships, and journal publications
are the best way to disseminate research. 
Prestigious conferences with very broad topics of interests are not.

Counter-arguments to the usual reasons for submitting to (prestigious) conferences
<ul>
	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#visibility">I want my results to be visible and quickly accessible</a>
	<div id="visibility" class="collapse">
	My answer is one sentence: Put your new results on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>. 
	This is will give your results a wide and immediate visibility. 
	Everyone knows and uses arxiv, it is very well referenced by scholar websites.
	I often send my latest arxiv link to a few (3 or 4) researchers who I think may be interested in the result.

	Visibility also means recognition, see the next item.
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stamp">I need the stamp of approval from prestigious conferences for my CV and being a member of my research community</a>
	<div id="stamp" class="collapse">
	No you do not. There are two things to consider here: is it about getting recognition for a specific paper, or about building up your CV and your place in the community. 

	For the research paper, every researcher I know will have enough judgment to make his own mind about your results, whether it is published in a top conference or not.
	There are many examples of papers in top conferences that no one ever read, and the other way around papers in less prestigious venues which have attracted a lot of attention.	
	
	For your CV, indeed a long list of prestigious conference papers looks good (well, in TCS only!).
	But this is only a first impression, which is very quickly replaced by your research interactions, ability to present your results, discuss them, relate them to others, and engage in developping new ideas.
	In the long run the correlation between your publication list and your place in the community is not that clear. 
	There are examples of all combinations: in particular, there are (fortunately not too many) researchers who have an impressive list of publications but whose research impact is debatable.
	Don't be one of them!
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#student">I want my students to thrive and get positions</a>
	<div id="student" class="collapse">
	I think this argument is flawed for two reasons.

	The first is that submitting to conferences is in pratice not that much "faster" than journals. 
	Factoring in the risk of getting rejected (which is higher for students in non-blind reviewing systems!) and the random aspect of the reviewing process for conferences, it probably pays off quickly to submit journal papers rather than conference papers.
	One may argue that for instance postdocs who are looking for positions need papers "now". 
	I sympathise with this as I was there just a few years ago, but again: given the odds, what is better, a very noisy shot at a prestigious conference or a more fair try at a journal?

	The second is that it is the advisor's responsibility to integrate their students to research communities, by involving them in research projects, inviting them to scientific events, and organising visits in other research groups.
	I believe these initiatives work better than a long list of conference publications.

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#informed">I want to be informed about the latest important results</a>
	<div id="informed" class="collapse">
	Sign up for the daily or weekly <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">arXiv alerting service</a> on your research interests.
	This will be far more efficient than attending a conference for a broad coverage of the latest results.

	For more specific results and deeper discussions you want to talk directly to the relevant researchers, and this is will much more fruitful in a specialised event than in a general conference.
	For instance, the Logic, Games, and Automata community organises every year a <a href="http://highlights-conference.org/">Highlights conference</a> where anyone can submit (at most) one talk and everyone is accepted (a similar event is organised in the Algorithms community). This is the perfect place to get up to date with results in the field.
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#isolation">I do not want to be scientifically isolated</a>
	<div id="isolation" class="collapse">
	This argument seems to rely on the idea that your research interactions are only or mostly through your conference publications. 
	There are many other ways to share your research, as listed above: seminar talks, one or two days specialised workshops, week-long group meetings (such as Dagstuhl or CIRM), weeks-long research visits, internships, and journal publications.
	I am tempting to add another one: I started writing a <a href="https://games-automata-play.github.io/">research blog</a>, and found that it is a very useful platform for stimulating research interactions. 	
	</div>


	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#small">I want to publish smaller results which are not yet ready for a journal publication</a>
	<div id="small" class="collapse">
	This is wrong.
	We should aim at publising <b>less</b>, not more. For a simple reason: the more we publish, the less visible our results are.
	On the other hand, nothing prevents you from publishing small results on arXiv. I actually do this quite a lot: if I have a result which I think is interesting but not yet a journal paper, I write a short paper / note and put it on arXiv. The actual publication may come much later, be a merge of different notes, and often is enriched by interactions stimulated by the arXiv paper.

Arguments in favour of submitting to journals
<ul>
	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#reviews">Escapes the unfair system of conference reviews</a>
	<div id="reviews" class="collapse">
	My experiences both as author and as PC member have convinced me that the system is rigged in a very vicious way.
	Many PC members spend a lot of effort trying to evaluate articles, find expert subreviewers, and select the best papers.
	Yet the outcome is still biassed.

	One widespread problem (for conferences which do not use double-blind reviewing system) is the correlation between authors names (hence reputation) and attention the papers get.

	Another problem is that tight deadlines and high competition imply that reviewers lose their benevolence. 
	Something is not to their taste, the presentation, outline or notations not ideal, that's a perfect reason to reject.
	The scientific part is sometimes less important than pure presentation aspects. 
	In a journal submission, would this be the case, the reviewer would ask for major revisions and make useful suggestions for improvements. 
	Conferences and their tight deadlines do not allow this simple process.
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#time">Avoids the huge waste of time of submitting and resubmitting to conferences</a>
	<div id="time" class="collapse">
	I have spent way too much time trying to fit my research results into conference papers (page limits, style, story, take away message, and other aspects). This is wrong. 
	This is a normative approach killing creativity.
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#deadlines">Breaks the untenable pace of conference deadlines</a>
	<div id="deadlines" class="collapse">
	This is wrong that a paper has to be ready for the next deadline. It encourages unpolished submissions, rushed proofs, and the practice of subdividing papers.
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#stress">Mitigates the stress of rejection</a>
	<div id="stress" class="collapse">
	Submitting a lot means getting rejected a lot. Notification dates are stressfull experiences, which personally affect me too much.
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#attending">Attending prestigious general conferences is not that productive and sometimes boring</a>
	<div id="attending" class="collapse">
	In some of the top conferences I may be able to understand about 30% of the talks (that's a very rough estimates, sometimes it's less).
	What is the point? 
	</div>

	<li><a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#trend">Free yourself from the trendy topics and dive into your niche topic!</a>
	<div id="trend" class="collapse">
	Another issue with conferences is that it encourages trendy topics, and it is very hard to get a paper about a nice topic published in a major conference.
	The best evidence of this being wrong is the decades during which neural networks was considered a niche topic with little applications, which meant that it was very hard to publish results on the topic. 
	Perseverance paid off, as Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio will explain when receiving their 2019 Turing award!
