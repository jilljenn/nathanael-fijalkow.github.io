L subset A^*
Online Complexity of L: size of the data structure maintaining answers to the boolean query "is the prefix in L?"

Number of different states after reading n letters 

Examples:
(i) a^n b^n: linear
(ii) as many a's as b's as c's: quadratic
(iii) squares: exponential

Theorem
(i) REG = Constant Online Complexity
(ii) DetPushdown subset Linear Online Complexity
(iii) The maximal complexity is exponential


2 Online Complexity of Probabilistic Automata
Question asked by Rabin

Theorem There exists a probabilistic language of exponential online complexity

3 Research Directions / Latest Results

- Dichotomy for PA: either polynomial or exponential
- Extend the framework to quantitative framework up to approximation,
and prove ProbREG = Constant Approximated Online Complexity
