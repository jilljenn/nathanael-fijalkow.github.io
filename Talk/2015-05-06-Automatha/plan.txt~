I Undecidability: Where the wild things are

- Rabin: Binary Decomposition, Non-regular behaviour, Emptiness: PCP
- Universally non-regular: double Rabin, regularity problem
- Sufficient condition for regularity: isolated cut-points, undecidability (FIND A NICE PROOF)
- Approximation: Condon Lipton, counting a^n b^n, simple example with threshold 1/2, two-way error bounded, weak one-way
- Numberless: emptiness
- Value 1: example, undecidability

II Decidability: Taming the beast

- Here: Value 1
- sequences of finite words: Sigma^0_2 (CHECK THIS PROOF AND THE EQUIVALENCE WITH BUCHI POSITIVE): complicated
- convergence speeds
- prostochastic theory, MMA,
- characterisation

Open problem: 
- emptiness for isolated cut-points?
- a good algorithm for emptiness?
- Skolem problem
- A simple algorithm for solving MDP
