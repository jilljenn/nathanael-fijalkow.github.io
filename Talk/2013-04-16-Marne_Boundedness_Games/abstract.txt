Boundedness games

In this talk, I will discuss some recent developments about boundedness games, which appear in different contexts, recently for instance in the study of regular cost-functions as defined by Thomas Colcombet.
They are two-player games featuring counters that can be incremented, reset of left unchanged,
and where the first player's objective is that the counters remain bounded along the play.
They can be played over finite graphs or infinite graphs, for instance over pushdown graphs.
I am interested in the following questions: deciding the winner, proving the existence of finite-memory strategies,
and constructing such strategies.

Based on joint works with Krishnendu Chatterjee, Thomas Colcombet, Florian Horn and Martin Zimmermann.
