	  <dt>Title:</dt>
	  <dd>Exact query learning of automata and context-free grammars</dd>

	  <dt>Abstract:</dt>
	  <dd>
In this talk we will discuss learning automata and context-free grammars in the exact query framework (Angluin, 1987).
We will start by discussing the general problem of learning when the instance space consists of discrete combinatorial objects like strings (trees, graphs and so on), and the minimally adequate teacher learning model, where the learner only has access to two sorts of queries: membership queries and equivalence queries. 
<br/>
We will then present Angluin's L-star algorithm for learning all regular sets via deterministic finite state automata, and extensions of this approach to the problem of learning  interesting subclasses of context-free grammars, and mildly context-sensitive extensions thereof.

	  <dt>Title:</dt>
	  <dd>Formal verification of complex systems: model-based and data-driven methods</dd>

	  <dt>Abstract:</dt>
	  <dd>
Two known shortcomings of standard techniques in formal verification are the limited capability to provide system-level assertions, and the scalability to large-scale, complex models, such as those needed in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications.  Using data, which nowadays is becoming ever more accessible, has the potential to mitigate such limitations. However, this notoriously leads to a lack of formal proofs that are needed in safety-critical systems.  
<br/><br/>
This talk covers research which addresses these shortcomings, by bringing model-based and data-driven methods together, which can help pushing the envelope of existing algorithms and tools in formal verification.  
<br/><br/>
In the first part of the talk, I will discuss a new, formal, measurement-driven and model-based automated technique, for the quantitative verification of systems with partly unknown dynamics. I will formulate this setup as a data-driven Bayesian inference problem, formally embedded within a quantitative, model-based verification procedure. I argue that the approach can be applied to complex physical systems (e.g., with spatially continuous variables), driven by external inputs and accessed under noisy measurements. 
<br/><br/>
In the later part of the talk, I will concentrate on systems represented by models that are probabilistic with heterogeneous dynamics (continuous/discrete, i.e. hybrid, as well as nonlinear). Such stochastic hybrid models (SHS) are a natural mathematical framework for CPS. With focus on model-based verification procedures, I will provide algorithms for quantitative model checking of temporal specifications on SHS with formal guarantees. This is attained via the development of formal abstraction techniques based on quantitative approximations. 
<br/><br/>
Theory is complemented by algorithms, all packaged in a software tool that is available to users, and applied in the domain of Smart Energy.
