<h3>The DeepSynth project</h3>

<a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/en/node/3181">Official announcement</a>
<br/><br/>

<b>Principal investigator:</b> Nathana&euml;l Fijalkow
<br/>
<b>Duration:</b> 2019 -- 2012 (3 years)
<br/>
<b>Budget:</b> 180k &euro; plus a two-year postdoc
<br/>
<b>Objectives:</b> 
The conception of computer programmes is a complicated, costly, and error-prone task.
Program synthesis is an ideal where the program is automatically generated from its specification.
It is a very hard problem requiring heavy resources both in computational time and memory. 
Recently, experiments achieved impressive results, showing that it is possible to synthesise complicated programs.
<br/>
The objective of the DeepSynth project is to use learning techniques for program synthesis.
